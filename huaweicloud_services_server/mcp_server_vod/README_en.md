| Media asset update | ShowRefreshResult | Query the refresh result. | To be tested |
|  | RefreshAsset | If the media asset status is Completed, Deleted, or Published, you can specify the media asset ID or URL to update the status in the CDN. This API is used to forcibly expire resources cached on CDN nodes.

A maximum of 1000 pre-heating nodes can be configured for a single tenant every day. | To be tested |
