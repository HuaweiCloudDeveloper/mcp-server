# AS MCP Server 


## Version
v0.1.0

## Overview

AS MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (Model Context Protocol) server, providing the ability for MCP clients (such as Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor) to interact with Huawei Cloud service AS. Full-chain management of AS resources can be carried out based on natural language.

## Available Tools
Cover all apis, use as needed, the list and status are as follows:

| 类别 | 工具名称 | 功能描述 | 状态 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auto Scaling Configuration | BatchDeleteScalingConfigs | This API is used to delete specified AS configurations in batches. The AS configuration used by the AS group cannot be deleted. A maximum of 50 AS configurations can be deleted at a time. | To be tested |
|  | DeleteScalingConfig | This API is used to delete a specified AS configuration. | To be tested |
|  | ListScalingConfigs | Query AS configurations based on the entered conditions. Query results are displayed on multiple pages. You can filter the AS configuration by name, image ID, start row number, and number of records. If no filtering condition is specified, a maximum of 20 AS configurations can be queried by default. | To be tested |
|  | ShowScalingConfig | Query details about an AS configuration by AS configuration ID. | To be tested |
|  | CreateScalingConfig | Create an AS configuration. An AS configuration is a template for instances (ECSs) in an AS group. It defines the specifications of the instances to be added to the AS group. AS configurations are decoupled from AS groups. One AS configuration can be used by multiple AS groups. By default, a maximum of 100 AS configurations can be created. | To be tested |
| Auto Scaling Group Management | PauseScalingGroup | This API is used to enable or disable a specified AS group. A disabled AS group does not automatically trigger any scaling action. If an AS group is being scaled, the ongoing scaling action will not stop immediately even if it is disabled. | To be tested |
|  | ShowScalingGroup | Query the details of a specified AS group. | To be tested |
|  | CreateScalingGroup | An AS group is a collection of instances with the same application scenario. It is the basic unit for starting or stopping scaling policies and performing scaling actions. An AS group defines the maximum number of instances, expected number of instances, minimum number of instances, VPC, subnet, and load balancer. By default, a maximum of 10 AS groups can be created. If load balancing is configured for the AS group, the load balancing listener is automatically bound to or unbound from the instance when you add or remove an instance. If the AS group uses the load balancer health check mode, the instance in the AS group can pass the health check only after the listening port of the load balancer is enabled. Ports can be enabled in the security group. For details, see Adding a Security Group Rule.  | To be tested |
|  | ListScalingGroups | Query the AS group list based on the specified conditions. Query results are displayed on multiple pages. You can filter the AS group name, AS configuration ID, AS group status, enterprise project ID, start row number, and number of records. If no filter criteria are specified, a maximum of 20 AS groups can be queried by default. | To be tested |
|  | ResumeScalingGroup | This API is used to enable or disable a specified AS group. A disabled AS group does not automatically trigger any scaling action. If the AS group is being scaled, the ongoing scaling action will not be stopped immediately even if it is disabled. | To be tested |
|  | UpdateScalingGroup | This API is used to modify information about a specified AS group. If the AS configuration is changed, the existing ECSs created using the original AS configuration in the AS group will not be affected. If no scaling action is in progress for an AS group, you can modify the subnet, AZ, and load balancing configuration of the AS group. When the expected number of instances in the AS group changes, the AS action will be triggered to add or remove instances. The number of expected instances must be greater than or equal to the minimum number of instances, and must be less than or equal to the maximum number of instances. | To be tested |
|  | DeleteScalingGroup | This API is used to delete a specified AS group. The force_delete property specifies whether to forcibly delete the AS group, remove the ECS instance, and release the ECS instance if the AS group has ECS instances or the scaling action is being performed. The default value is no, indicating that the AS group is not forcibly deleted. If the value of force_delete is no, the AS group can be deleted only when the following conditions are met:Condition 1: No scaling action is in progress in the AS group. Condition 2: The number of ECS instances in the AS group (current_instance_number) is 0. If the value of force_delete is yes, the AS group enters the DELETING state and refuses to receive new AS action requests. After the existing AS actions are complete, all ECS instances in the AS group are removed from the AS group. (The ECS instances manually added by the user will be removed from the AS group, and the ECS instances automatically created by the AS will be automatically deleted.) and delete the AS group. | To be tested |

Note: - A maximum of 10 instances can be operated in a batch at a time. The number of instances added in batches cannot be greater than the maximum number of instances in the AS group. The number of instances removed in batches cannot be less than the minimum number of instances in the AS group. - Instances can be added only when the AS group is in the INSERVICE state and no scaling action has been performed. - An AS instance can be removed only when no scaling action has been performed in the AS group. - When adding an instance to an AS group, ensure that the AZ where the instance resides is contained in the AZ of the AS group. - You can remove, set, or cancel the protection attributes of an instance only when the instance is in the INSERVICE state. - When the AS group is automatically scaled in, the instances with instance protection enabled will not be removed from the AS group. - When instances are removed from an AS group in batches, if the listener bound to the instances is the same as the listener in the AS group, the instances will be detached from the listener. If the listener bound to the instance when the instance is added to the AS group is different from the listener in the AS group, the binding relationship between the instance and the listener will be retained. | To be tested |

| Lifecycle Hook Management | AttachCallbackInstanceLifeCycleHook | Use the lifecycle operation token or the instance ID and lifecycle hook name to call back the hook specified by the AS instance.

After the lifecycle hook is added, the instance will be suspended by the lifecycle hook and put in the waiting state (being added to or removed from the AS group) when the AS group performs scaling. The instance remains in the waiting state until the timeout period expires or the user manually invokes the instance. Users can perform custom actions during the time period that the instance remains in the waiting state, for example, they can install or configure software on a newly started instance, or download log files from the instance before the instance terminates. | To be tested |
